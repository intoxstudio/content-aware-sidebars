###Add Unlimited Sidebars & Widget Areas

Create a post sidebar, a page sidebar, a category sidebar, or any custom sidebar you need - no coding required. **CAS will never slow down your site**, even if you create a lot of custom sidebars and conditions. 

> **Sidebars - Quick Select&copy; lets you add or select widget areas directly when editing a post or page.**

###Schedule & Disable Custom Sidebars

In the All-in-one Sidebar Manager you **just pick a start and end date** for when widget areas should be displayed, and CAS will take care of the rest.

> **1-Click Sidebar Activation&copy; lets you activate or deactivate widget areas instantly.**

###The Most User-friendly Widget Manager

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I need to know widget logic PHP code? =

Of course not!

CAS is praised by users for its unparalleled sidebar and widget visibility options. It's the only plugin that allows you to display widget areas on literally any condition without any code.

= Will this sidebar plugin work with my theme? =

Yes!

If your theme already has WordPress sidebars and widget areas, you can create new custom sidebars to replace, merge with or hide those on certain conditions.

You can also display custom sidebars using the sidebar shortcode [ca-sidebar id=""] anywhere in your content.

If your theme has a built-in sidebar generator, it is recommended to disable it and/or only use CAS for maximum speed and compatibility.
= Can I really display sidebars and widget areas on any page? =

Yes!

In the Sidebar Editor, you can select where, when and to whom your sidebar should be displayed. Create a sidebar for each page, a sidebar for posts in a category, or any sidebar you need, all in a user-friendly UI.

You can also select sidebars directly when you're editing a post or page.

= Will CAS work with block-based Widgets? =

Yes!

If you prefer to manage widgets in the traditional way, you can use [Classic Widgets](https://wordpress.org/plugins/classic-widgets/) which CAS also supports.

Moreover, the Pro version makes it possible to infuse widget areas into theme hooks, as well as insert areas between content paragraphs.

= Will this plugin work with page builders? =

Yes!

Many users already compliment CAS with popular page builder plugins such as Elementor, SiteOrigin Page Builder, Beaver Builder, and Visual Composer.
